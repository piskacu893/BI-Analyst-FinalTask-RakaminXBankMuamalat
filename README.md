## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing in BigQuery

Example query to create a **master sales table**:

```sql
SELECT 
  o.Date AS order_date,
  pc.CategoryName AS category_name,
  p.ProdName AS product_name,
  p.Price AS product_price,
  o.Quantity AS order_qty,
  (p.Price * o.Quantity) AS total_sales,
  c.CustomerEmail AS cust_email,
  c.CustomerCity AS cust_city
FROM `finalproject-476410.master_sales.orders` AS o
JOIN `finalproject-476410.master_sales.customers` AS c
  ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN `finalproject-476410.master_sales.products` AS p
  ON o.ProdNumber = p.ProdNumber
JOIN `finalproject-476410.master_sales.product_category` AS pc
  ON p.Category = pc.CategoryID
ORDER BY o.Date ASC;
